How to use:
Open the main.py program.
Click file -> Open and browse to a premade chinese test. Example is example.txt.
To make your own test:
Open up a new text document (Not word file)
On each line write in the chinese,pinyin,and then english meanings all seperate by commas, with no leading or trailing spaces. 
At the end of the line write a semicolon
Example:
好,hao3,good;
小，xiao3,small，little；
You can add extra english meanings by adding extra words seperated by commas at the end of the first english meaning like the small,little example above.
Every line must end in a semicolon, including the last line.
When you are done you can save the file as a text document(make sure to click on the encoding button near the save button and choose UTF-8) anywhere and load it in the program.
The program will automatically randomize the order the questions are displayed on screen, making it not repetitive.
